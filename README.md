# Eq2Graph
A Python + React project that converts algebraic equations into interactive graphs. Users can input linear, quadratic, and more complex equations, and visualize their plots dynamically in the browser. The Python backend handles equation parsing and computation, while the React frontend renders interactive, zoomable graphs.
